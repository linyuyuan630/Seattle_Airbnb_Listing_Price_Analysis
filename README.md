# Project

## Seattle Airbnb Listing Price Analysis

The dataset used in this study is a public dataset from AirBnB.

Airbnb is a popular online platform in the USA for lodging services. Similar to a broker, the company itself does not own any real estate. The company's profit is based upon the commission for each booking. The hosts list their properties on Airbnb and accept or deny the booking request by the other Airbnb members. The hosts' income is mainly from the listing price. To maximize the income or even to evaluate if it is worthwhile to list a property, it is critical to understand the relation beween the prices and other factors such as time, location, room condition, reviews, house rules and others. For the scope of this study, I will try to answer the following 4 questions:

- What is the price range?
- Are there any seasonal, weekly trends of the listing price?
- How is the impact of zipcode on the listing price?
- What is the correlation beween listing price and other factors?
