# Project Motivation

The dataset used in this study is a public dataset from AirBnB. This is a Udacity project which helps student with the CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining).

Airbnb is a popular online platform in the USA for lodging services. Since 2015 I started to search for rooms on Airbnb as alternatives to hotel rooms, especially when I plan to travel to cities such as Seattle, New Yoke, Vancouver where the hotel room prices are very expensive. At the same time, I am also considering to rent some of the spare rooms out in my own house.

Similar to a broker, the Airbnb itself does not own any real estate. The company’s profit is based upon the commission for each booking. The hosts list their properties on Airbnb and accept or deny the booking request by the other Airbnb members. The hosts’ income is mainly from the listing price. To maximize the income or even to evaluate if it is worthwhile to list a property, it is critical to understand the relation between the prices and other factors such as time, location, room condition, reviews, house rules and others. For the scope of this study, I analyzed the public available Seattle Airbnb dataset, and tried to answer the following 4 questions:

- What is the price range?
- Are there any seasonal, weekly trends of the listing price?
- How is the impact of zipcode on the listing price?
- What is the correlation beween listing price and other factors?

# File Descriptions
The notebook with markdowns can walk through the entire project. However, to run the notebook smoothly, 3 csv files listing.csv, calendar.csv and review.csv should be availble for the raw dataset. In the repository, only the listing.csv file is avilable. The calender and review csv files are not uploaded due to the size limit. Please download using the link:
